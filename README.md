<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![alt text](https://github.com/chinhtrung/my-piano/blob/master/public/src/picture/web_screenshot.PNG)

There are many great virtual piano websites but I decide to create my own one. Since I have background in playing piano, I hope that it will help me in designing this website to improve the experience of users. I want to make it as simple as possible in the playstyle, I name my project <strong> The Simple Piano </strong>

Here's my ultimate goal: üéπ
* It should be simple and intuitive to use for everyone
* Your piano skill can be transfered from real life to the internet
* Your playstyle, keypress combination can be improved from time to time

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
